# 9_SQL_Project

This project involves modeling, creating and conducting analysis with a sample database of employee/hiring information. Included in the repository is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the relationships between the tables within the database. There is also a schema file (.sql format) which can be used to create the necessary tables for the .csv files to be imported into PostgreSQL. Finally, the analysis.sql file conducts some initial queries from the database, utilizing joins, where clauses, group-by and order-by functions, and aggregate (COUNT) functions in order to filter and display information from the database.
